    "Examples above show that some functions or operators, such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>, may perform differently as they are applied to operands with different data types. There are times we need to convert data between types in order to manipulate them in the desired way. In Python, data type conversions can be conducted by using the type name as the conversion function. For example, the function <code>int()</code> converts an object into an <code>int</code> type object, and <code>float()</code> converts an object into <code>float</code> type.  \n",
